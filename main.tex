\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}

% General  instructions / Best Practice Rules:
% ------------------------------------
% * Use \cref{<label>} only, no \ref !
% * For abbreviations, always use the Glossaries package and \gls{<abbrv>} or
%   \glspl{<abbrv>} ! --> ensures that every abbreviation is introduced correctly
% * Mark open points with \todo{ <Name of assigned person>: ... }
% * Only commit after checking that it compiles. 
% * Only one sentence per line!
% * Use active voice whenever possible! ("we have investigated" instead of "it
%   was investigated")
% * Use past progressive instead of simple past! ("Banks et al. have shown"
%   instead of "Banks et al. showed")
